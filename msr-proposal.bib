  abstract = {This thesis presents a comprehensive exploration into pedestrian navigation systems, addressing critical shortcomings and redefining the landscape of pedestrian route planning. Grounded in a systematic analysis of existing literature and research gaps, the study establishes clear and focused objectives to develop an innovative and adaptive route optimization solution. The research introduces a Personalised Multi-Objective Pedestrian Route Planning System, designed to generate safe, accessible, attractive, comfortable, and overall pedestrian-friendly route by balancing multiple conflicting objectives such as safety, attractiveness, comfort, and accessibility. To ensure practical applicability, a post-optimization process is applied to select the most suitable solution from the generated Pareto front, aligning with pedestrian preferences. Key contributions include the development of comprehensive hierarchical taxonomies for categorizing route choice factors by pedestrians, a novel multi-objective pedestrian route planning problem along with associated model and framework, and an advanced GIS-based methodology for pedestrian network data preparation. The study also integrates metaheuristic algorithms, particularly Pareto-Based Multi-Objective Ant Colony Optimization (PB-MOACO) algorithm, to enhance decision-making in route selection. The effectiveness of PB-MOACO is validated through a comparative evaluation against two benchmark algorithms: Multi-Objective ACO via Weighted Aggregation (MOACO-WA) expanded and customised for this study and Dijkstra’s algorithm. Results demonstrate that PB-MOACO outperforms both benchmarks in generating safer, comfier and more pedestrian-friendly routes while maintaining reasonable computing times. Real-world validation using truth data (actual path lengths, safety conditions, comfort attributes, scenic status along the route) further confirms the superiority of the proposed approach over traditional methods. Beyond academic contributions, this research has practical implications for urban mobility planning, pedestrian safety, and intelligent transportation systems. By addressing the limitations of existing pedestrian navigation systems and introducing an adaptive, user-centric approach, this study enhances personalized pedestrian routing, offering a more efficient, flexible, and safer navigation experience.},

  abstract = {Although conspiracy beliefs are often viewed as resistant to correction, recent evidence shows that personalized, fact-based dialogues with a large language model (LLM) can reduce them. Is this effect driven by the debunking facts and evidence, or does it rely on the messenger being an Artificial Intelligence (AI)? In other words, would the same message be equally effective if delivered by a human? To answer this question, we conducted a preregistered experiment (N = 955) in which participants reported either a conspiracy belief or a non-conspiratorial but epistemically unwarranted belief and interacted with a LLM that argued against that belief using facts and evidence. We randomized whether the debunking LLM was characterized as an AI tool or a human expert and whether the model used human-like conversational tone. The conversations significantly reduced participants’ confidence in both conspiracies and epistemically unwarranted beliefs, with no significant differences across conditions. Thus, AI persuasion is not reliant on the messenger being an AI model: it succeeds by generating compelling messages.},

  abstract = {While most of us take wayfinding and orientation for granted, instinctively utilizing our visual channels to do so, millions of blind people around the world face challenges and obstacles when attempting to perform the most basic tasks, such as walking to the corner store or using public transportation. As blind pedestrians lack critical information about the space they traverse outside the familiarity of their home, they are restricted, dependent on others, and have decreased quality of life. While assistive technologies for providing specific navigation solutions do exist, research is still limited regarding customized wayfinding solutions for blind pedestrians. This research aims at developing a wayfinding algorithm that relies on the OpenStreetMap mapping catalogue for planning accessible and safe routes specifically suited to blind pedestrians. In-depth investigations, observations, and interviews were conducted with blind people and with orientation and mobility instructors, in order to define and categorize spatial criteria relating to mobility, accessibility, and safety. Using controlled iterative experiments, weighted network graph criteria were defined, leading to the development of a route planning software that generates optimized routes for blind pedestrians. The developed software was then tested on a variety of routes, with the help of blind volunteers and orientation and mobility instructors. The results show that the optimal routes generated by the software were identical or very similar to those suggested by the experienced orientation and mobility instructors. Moreover, the blind volunteers also stated that the software planned routes were indeed more accessible and safer for them to walk along compared to routes suggested by existing commercial software developed for seeing pedestrians. The findings of this research indicate that our solution, based on OpenStreetMap and developed for the benefit of blind pedestrians, is effective and practical, and could improve the mobility, independence, and quality of life of this population, as well as increasing their integration into society.},
