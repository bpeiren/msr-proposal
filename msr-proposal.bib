  abstract = {This thesis presents a comprehensive exploration into pedestrian navigation systems, addressing critical shortcomings and redefining the landscape of pedestrian route planning. Grounded in a systematic analysis of existing literature and research gaps, the study establishes clear and focused objectives to develop an innovative and adaptive route optimization solution. The research introduces a Personalised Multi-Objective Pedestrian Route Planning System, designed to generate safe, accessible, attractive, comfortable, and overall pedestrian-friendly route by balancing multiple conflicting objectives such as safety, attractiveness, comfort, and accessibility. To ensure practical applicability, a post-optimization process is applied to select the most suitable solution from the generated Pareto front, aligning with pedestrian preferences. Key contributions include the development of comprehensive hierarchical taxonomies for categorizing route choice factors by pedestrians, a novel multi-objective pedestrian route planning problem along with associated model and framework, and an advanced GIS-based methodology for pedestrian network data preparation. The study also integrates metaheuristic algorithms, particularly Pareto-Based Multi-Objective Ant Colony Optimization (PB-MOACO) algorithm, to enhance decision-making in route selection. The effectiveness of PB-MOACO is validated through a comparative evaluation against two benchmark algorithms: Multi-Objective ACO via Weighted Aggregation (MOACO-WA) expanded and customised for this study and Dijkstra’s algorithm. Results demonstrate that PB-MOACO outperforms both benchmarks in generating safer, comfier and more pedestrian-friendly routes while maintaining reasonable computing times. Real-world validation using truth data (actual path lengths, safety conditions, comfort attributes, scenic status along the route) further confirms the superiority of the proposed approach over traditional methods. Beyond academic contributions, this research has practical implications for urban mobility planning, pedestrian safety, and intelligent transportation systems. By addressing the limitations of existing pedestrian navigation systems and introducing an adaptive, user-centric approach, this study enhances personalized pedestrian routing, offering a more efficient, flexible, and safer navigation experience.},

  abstract = {Although conspiracy beliefs are often viewed as resistant to correction, recent evidence shows that personalized, fact-based dialogues with a large language model (LLM) can reduce them. Is this effect driven by the debunking facts and evidence, or does it rely on the messenger being an Artificial Intelligence (AI)? In other words, would the same message be equally effective if delivered by a human? To answer this question, we conducted a preregistered experiment (N = 955) in which participants reported either a conspiracy belief or a non-conspiratorial but epistemically unwarranted belief and interacted with a LLM that argued against that belief using facts and evidence. We randomized whether the debunking LLM was characterized as an AI tool or a human expert and whether the model used human-like conversational tone. The conversations significantly reduced participants’ confidence in both conspiracies and epistemically unwarranted beliefs, with no significant differences across conditions. Thus, AI persuasion is not reliant on the messenger being an AI model: it succeeds by generating compelling messages.},

  abstract = {While most of us take wayfinding and orientation for granted, instinctively utilizing our visual channels to do so, millions of blind people around the world face challenges and obstacles when attempting to perform the most basic tasks, such as walking to the corner store or using public transportation. As blind pedestrians lack critical information about the space they traverse outside the familiarity of their home, they are restricted, dependent on others, and have decreased quality of life. While assistive technologies for providing specific navigation solutions do exist, research is still limited regarding customized wayfinding solutions for blind pedestrians. This research aims at developing a wayfinding algorithm that relies on the OpenStreetMap mapping catalogue for planning accessible and safe routes specifically suited to blind pedestrians. In-depth investigations, observations, and interviews were conducted with blind people and with orientation and mobility instructors, in order to define and categorize spatial criteria relating to mobility, accessibility, and safety. Using controlled iterative experiments, weighted network graph criteria were defined, leading to the development of a route planning software that generates optimized routes for blind pedestrians. The developed software was then tested on a variety of routes, with the help of blind volunteers and orientation and mobility instructors. The results show that the optimal routes generated by the software were identical or very similar to those suggested by the experienced orientation and mobility instructors. Moreover, the blind volunteers also stated that the software planned routes were indeed more accessible and safer for them to walk along compared to routes suggested by existing commercial software developed for seeing pedestrians. The findings of this research indicate that our solution, based on OpenStreetMap and developed for the benefit of blind pedestrians, is effective and practical, and could improve the mobility, independence, and quality of life of this population, as well as increasing their integration into society.},

  abstract = {Route planning is an important tool to reach points of interest. The current technology offers options for public transportation and pedestrians on the road and sidewalks, respectively. However, for people who use electric powered wheelchairs (EPW) as their primary means of mobility, the level of accessibility and EPW battery consumption are important during route planning. This paper introduces the concept of an accessible route navigation application to reduce EPW battery consumption. The application, called eNav, uses five layers of information including OpenStreetMaps (OSM), airborne laser scanner (ALS), Point-of-Interests (POIs), public transportation, and crowdsourcing. eNav collects these layers of information to provide the shortest, most accessible, and most comfortable routes that consume the least amount of EPW battery. Additionally, the paper presents the Mobility Enhancement roBot (MEBot), a legged-wheeled power wheelchair, to drive over architectural barriers and less accessible environments. The paper proposes the use of MEBot as a sixth layer of information to inform eNav and road authorities about sidewalk/route conditions, to improve road accessibility, and to provide an energy efficient route planning for non-MEBot users.},

  abstract = {Mobility is fundamental for social participation. Everyone benefits from pedestrian networks for their mobility and daily activities. People without disabilities may have little difficulty walking on narrow sidewalks, over potholes, and so on. However, people with motor disabilities (PWMD) may find it more difficult to deal with such conditions. For PWMD, even routine trips are often fraught with problems, with many different obstacles restricting their mobility and consequently rendering their participation in social and recreational activities difficult. The potential problems and risks associated with mobility for PWMD could be significantly reduced if navigation systems provided them with appropriate accessible routes. These routes should consider PWMD’s personal capabilities as well as sidewalk-network conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for computing a user-specific route for PWMD. Such a route is personalized based on the user’s confidence to deal with obstacles such as slopes, uneven pavement, etc. We show how user reported confidence levels could be used to aggregate sidewalk conditions in a routing model to offer user-specific routes. The proposed methodology was developed using a fuzzy approach and is evaluated by manual wheelchair users in Quebec City.},

  abstract = {Ensuring equitable access to urban environments is essential for inclusive cities. This study presents the development of an Accessibility Routing Model that improves navigation for physically able, mobility impaired, and visually impaired pedestrians. Unlike previous research that focused on footway width and slope to evaluate accessibility, this study, through an optimisation model, integrates key accessibility criteria, such as footway width, footway slope, kerb design, tactile paving, and the presence of obstacles. Based on extensive audits conducted in the municipality of Penteli (Athens), data were collected from over 400 locations, and accessibility maps were produced for each user group. The routing algorithm calculates the shortest accessible path or, if necessary, an alternative path with minimal violations of accessibility standards. A mobile application was developed to deliver real-time route suggestions tailored to users’ abilities. The paper highlights gaps in urban design and emphasizes the urgent need for improvements to foster independence and social inclusion for vulnerable road users.

This study presents a model to evaluate routes based on accessibility criteria to determine the most suitable paths for disabled individuals navigating a university. First, the main factors of accessible mobility were determined and rated by students with physical disabilities. Within this context, this study used the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to weight criteria and route alternatives. İnönü University was selected for quantifying the path network of its campus by physically handicapped students. Three main campus routes were evaluated to find the most accessible route for students. Based on the results, among ten key factors, ramp slope and paving are the most important. Furthermore, on-site analyses demonstrated the accuracy of the AHP method for this research. Contributions of the study include a model for determining the optimal route with the fewest physical obstacles to facilitate disabled individuals’ daily movement.},
